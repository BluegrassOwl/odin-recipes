    <h2>A Fine Example of Deserts From Another Land</h2>
        <p>Burnt Basque cheesecake is the antithesis of American-style or New York cheesecakes. 
           It wants to cook at a high temperature without the protection of a water bath. It wants
           to get browned and crack, to soufflé high and then deflate. It eschews a crust, instead 
           forming its own where heat and surface area meet. In essence, all the things that make
           BA’s Best Cheesecake so great are the exact wrong things to do here. What does that mean?
           It’s virtually impossible to mess up this easy recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unsalted butter (for pan)</li>
            <li>2lb. cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>1½cups sugar</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt</li>
            <li>tsp. vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Process for Success</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400°. Brush pan with unsalted butter, 
                then line with 2 overlapping 16x12" sheets of parchment paper, making sure parchment 
                comes at least 2" above top of pan on all sides. Because the parchment needs to be 
                pleated and creased in some areas to fit in pan, you won’t end up with a clean, smooth 
                outer edge to the cake; that’s okay! Place pan on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Beat 2 lb. cream cheese, room temperature, and 1½ cups (300 g) sugar in the bowl of a 
                stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed, scraping down sides 
                of the bowl, until very smooth, no lumps remain, and sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. 
                (You can also use a large bowl with a hand mixer on medium low-speed, but you may need to 
                continue beating for a few extra minutes to dissolve sugar).</li>
            <li>Increase speed to medium and add 6 large eggs, one egg at a time, beating until each egg 
                is incorporated, about 15 seconds, before adding the next. Scrape down sides of bowl, then 
                reduce mixer speed to medium-low. Add 2 cups heavy cream, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. 
                Morton kosher salt, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract and beat until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Turn off mixer and sift ⅓ cup (42 g) all-purpose flour evenly over cream cheese mixture using 
                a fine-mesh sieve. Beat on low speed until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Scrape down sides 
                of the bowl (yet again) and continue to beat until batter is very smooth, homogenous, 
                and silky, about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cheesecake until deeply golden brown on top and still 
                    very jiggly in the center, 60–65 minutes.</li>
             <li>Let cool slightly (cake will collapse drastically as it cools), then unmold. Let cool 
                 completely. Carefully peel away parchment from sides of cheesecake. Slice into wedges 
                 and serve at room temperature, preferably with a glass of sherry alongside.
                 Do Ahead: Basque cheesecake can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Let cheesecake 
                 sit at room temperature for several hours to remove chill before serving.</li>
