    <h2>A fine example of desserts from another land</h2>
        <p>Burnt Basque cheesecake is the antithesis of American-style or New York cheesecakes. 
           It wants to cook at a high temperature without the protection of a water bath. It wants
           to get browned and crack, to soufflé high and then deflate. It eschews a crust, instead 
           forming its own where heat and surface area meet. In essence, all the things that make
           BA’s Best Cheesecake so great are the exact wrong things to do here. What does that mean?
           It’s virtually impossible to mess up this easy recipe.</p>
