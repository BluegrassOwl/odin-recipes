    <h2>A treat for your senses</h2>
        <p>A delicious mixture of savory, salty, and acidic will tease your tastebuds 
        throughout the meal. I originally found the recipe online and have since modified 
        it a bit.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>12 oz. jumbo pasta shells</li>
                <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
                <li>5 ounces fresh spinach</li>
                <li>2 cups ricotta cheese, 16 ounces</li>
                <li>¼ cup grated pecorino cheese, plus more for sprinkling</li>
                <li>5 garlic cloves, grated. We love garlic</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon sea salt, plus more for the pasta water</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 cups Mazzenta marinara sauce, plus more for serving</li>
                <li>Chopped fresh parsley, for serving</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Steps to success</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375&deg;F</li>
                <li>Place the spinach in a steamer basket and set over a pot with 1-inch of water.
                    Bring the water to a simmer, cover, and let steam for 1 minute, until the spinach
                    is wilted. Transfer to a strainer and squeeze out the excess water and chop the spinach.</li>
                <li>n a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the pasta shells for 10 minutes, until al dente. 
                    Drain and drizzle with a little olive oil to keep them from sticking together.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the spinach with the ricotta, pecorino, garlic, oregano, lemon zest, 
                    red pepper flakes, salt, and several grinds of pepper.</li>
                <li>Spread the marinara in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Stuff each shell with the filling 
                    and place in the dish. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Serve with more marinara on the side.</li>
